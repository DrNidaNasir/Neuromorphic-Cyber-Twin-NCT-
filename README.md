#  Neuromorphic-Cyber-Twin (NCT)

Prototype code and sample results for the **Neuromorphic Cyber-Twin (NCT)** framework.  
This project explores the use of **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** and **Digital Twin concepts** for cybersecurity anomaly detection.

##  Notebooks

- **NCT.ipynb** – Initial prototype using synthetic spike inputs for anomaly detection with Brian2.  
- **NCT2.ipynb** – Extended version with the NSL-KDD dataset, includes ML baseline comparisons and performance metrics.  
- **NCT3.ipynb** – Full evaluation pipeline integrating SNNs with a Digital Twin framework.
